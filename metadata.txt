abstract:
    For dynamic languages, there are well known approaches to achieve maximum performance, e.g. JIT. But such approaches are often very expensive to implement and maintain. In this talk we'll look at ways of implementing interpreters for less frequently used languages, which necessarily trade off performance vs implementation effort. As an example, we will consider the Starlark configuration language, a deterministic subset of Python used by the build systems Buck and Bazel. We'll cover techniques such direct AST interpretation, bytecode, closure generation - comparing the effort and performance of each approach.

abstract:
    Build scripts for most build systems describe the actions to run, and the dependencies between those actions - but often build scripts get those dependencies wrong.
    Most build scripts have both too few dependencies (leading to incorrect build outputs) and too many dependencies (leading to excessive rebuilds and reduced parallelism). Any programmer who has wondered why a small change led to excess compilation, or who resorted to a clean step, has suffered the ill effects of incorrect dependency specification.
    We outline a build system where dependencies are not specified, but instead captured by tracing execution.
    The consequence is that dependencies are always correct by construction and build scripts are easier to write.
    The simplest implementation of our approach would lose parallelism, but we are able to recover parallelism using speculation.

text: How and why we changed #{hlint} to the GHC API parser.
abstract:
    HLint is over 14 years old. Over the last 14 years we've changed license, project name, source control, configuration and much more besides. But until recently, HLint had always used the haskell-src-exts library for parsing Haskell. That parser was forked from the GHC parser 16 years ago, and as GHC has accumulated 16 years worth of bug fixes and features, the amount of Haskell code that could be parsed by GHC but not HLint increased. The obvious solution was to use the GHC API for parsing. In this talk I'll describe why we were so reluctant to move to the GHC API, how we decoupled HLint from GHC versions with ghc-lib, and how to change almost every line in a large project, without breaking anything or stopping ongoing development.

text: How to improve Haskell records.
abstract:
    Sadly, Haskell records aren't very good - problems include that field names must be unique and that record updates are not very expressive. A variety of solutions have been proposed over many decades, but none has gained traction. The closest answer Haskell has is the lens library, which famously ups the bar on complexity.

    This talk explains how to fix all the pain, and make records a strength of Haskell, without making them harder to use. We show how to encode records and fields in a type class, then use existing Haskell machinery to abstract over multiple field names. This type class has been added to GHC, and is automatically generated for standard Haskell records. Building on that, we provide a convenient syntax through a Haskell preprocessor.

    We've validated our design with the DAML programming language (based on the GHC compiler) which uses these records as standard. We're happy to report that users experiences have been very positive.

abstract:
    I've always wanted a Haskell IDE. The absence of a simple and robust solution led me to build #{ghcid}, which I've been using for many years. However, I have moved on, now using a real Haskell IDE based on technology we developed at Digital Asset for the DAML programming language. It turns out building an IDE is harder than I expected, so in this talk I'll cover three topics:

    1. The theory behind building an IDE. We use an in-memory dependency graph, with some interesting tweaks.

    2. What's there today and how you can use it. I'll also cover the relationship to haskell-ide-engine, DAML and other related projects.

    3. What's missing and how you can help. I'll be hacking on the IDE at MuniHac, and everyone is welcome to join in.

abstract:
    Haskell has lots of XML parsing libraries, implemented using different techniques, and offering different levels of performance. In this talk, you will learn why, until recently, even the fastest of these libraries was embarrassingly slow compared to state-of-the-art XML parsers. Neil will share how the issue was rectified, with the introduction of the Hexml and Xeno libraries. Hexml uses the Foreign Function Interface (FFI), pushing much of the actual work into C, showing how to move performance sensitive pieces into C and reintegrate them without excessive overhead. In contrast, Xeno is written in pure Haskell, using special development/testing techniques to ensure the optimised code performs comparably to Hexml. You will explore the comparison between these different approaches, and see how they apply beyond just XML parsing.

text: How to detect and fix space leaks.
abstract:
    Confused by foldl' vs foldl? Unsure when you've got the strictness right? Programs taking too much memory and running too slow? You are not alone! Most Haskell programs suffer from "space leaks" - this talk covers examples (all only found and fixed in the last year) from the base library, QuickCheck, pretty, Happy, Alex and Shake. Some fixes saved over 1Gb of memory! Space leaks occur when a program uses more memory than necessary. Haskell, as a lazy language, is particularly vulnerable to a form of space leak where a small accumulator (e.g. an Int) is instead represented by a sequence of updates that grows on each iteration. In this talk, you will learn the gritty details of space leaks, then the session sets off on a quest to remove them from all Haskell programs. You will explore the relationship between space leaks and stack usage, then how to use the existing tools built in to GHC to detect and debug excessive stack usage. These techniques have already slain lots of space leaks, and hopefully in your hands they can destroy even more.

text: Designing general purpose custom rules for #{shake}, targeted towards building C.
abstract:
    Shake is a general purpose library for expressing build systems - forms of computation, with caching, dependencies and more besides. Like all the best stuff in Haskell, Shake is generic, with details such as "files" written on top of the generic library. Of course, the real world doesn't just have "files", but specifically has "C files that need to be compiled with gcc". In this hacking session we'll look at how to write Shake rules, what existing functions people have already layered on top of Shake for compiling with specific compilers, and consider which rules are missing. Hopefully by the end we'll have a rule that people can use out-of-the-box for compiling C++ and Haskell.

text: How to define large build systems using #{shake}, particularly a new GHC build system.
abstract:
    Most build systems start small and simple, but over time grow into hairy monsters
    that few dare to touch. As we demonstrate in this paper, there are a few issues
    that cause build systems major scalability challenges, and many pervasively
    used build systems (e.g. Make) do not scale well.

    This paper presents a solution to the challenges we identify. We use functional
    programming to design abstractions for build systems, and implement
    them on top of the Shake library, which allows us to describe build rules and
    dependencies. To substantiate our claims, we engineer a new build system
    for the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. The result is more scalable, faster, and
    spectacularly more maintainable than its Make-based predecessor.

text: How to define your own build system using #{shake}.
abstract:
    Shake, like Make, is a tool for writing build systems. However, unlike Make, Shake features monadic dependencies (your dependencies themselves can depend on the results of previous dependencies), polymorphic dependencies (your dependencies don't have to be files) and stable dependencies (if something rebuilds but doesn't change things that depend on it don't have to rebuild). These features make it much easier to define build systems that have accurate dependencies. Additionally, these features let you define your own custom build system, and then implement a Shake-based interpreter for it. It is often said that the easiest way to solve a problem is to define the perfect language for solving the problem, then write an interpreter. In this talk we'll see how to use Shake to apply that advice to build systems.

abstract:
    A large software project is more than just the code that goes into a release, in particular you need lots of glue code to put everything together - including build systems, test harnesses, installer generators etc. While the choice of language for the project is often a carefully considered decision, more often than not the glue code consists of shell scripts and Makefiles. But just as functional programming provides a better way to write the project, it also provides a better way to write the glue code.  This talk covers some of the technologies and approaches we use at Standard Chartered to glue together the quant library. In particular, we'll focus on the build system where we replaced 10,000 lines of Makefiles with 1,000 lines of Haskell which builds the project twice as fast. We'll also look at how to test programs using Haskell, how to replace ancillary shell scripts with Haskell, and how to use Haskell to generate installers.

    Build systems are a key part of any large software project, relied upon by both developers and release processes. It's important that the build system is understandable, reliable and fast.

    This talk introduces the Shake build system which is intended to help meet those goals. Users of Shake write a Haskell program which makes heavy use of the Shake library, while still allowing the full power of Haskell to be used.

    The Shake library provides powerful dependency features along with useful extras (profiling, debugging, command line handling). This tutorial aims to help you learn how to think about writing build systems, and how to make those thoughts concrete in Shake.

    be specified before the build starts. This restriction makes many dependency patterns difficult to express,
    especially those involving files generated at build time. We show how to eliminate this restriction,
    allowing additional dependencies to be specified while building. We have implemented our ideas in the
    Haskell library Shake, and have used Shake to write a complex build system which compiles millions of lines of code.

    Supercompilation is a program optimisation technique that is particularly
    effective at eliminating unnecessary overheads. We have designed a new supercompiler,
    making many novel choices, including different termination criteria and handling of
    let bindings. The result is a supercompiler that focuses on simplicity, compiles
    programs quickly and optimises programs well. We have benchmarked our supercompiler,
    with some programs running more than twice as fast than when compiled with GHC.

abstract:
    Given an appropriate domain specific language (DSL), it is possible
    to describe the relationship between Haskell data types and many
    generic functions, typically type-class instances. While describing
    the relationship is possible, it is not always an easy task. There is an
    alternative - simply give one example output for a carefully chosen
    input, and have the relationship derived.

    When deriving a relationship from only one example, it is important
    that the derived relationship is the intended one. We identify
    general restrictions on the DSL, and on the provided example, to
    ensure a level of predictability. We then apply these restrictions in
    practice, to derive the relationship between Haskell data types and
    generic functions. We have used our scheme in the Derive tool,
    where over 60% of type classes are derived from a single example.

    We describe a transformation which takes a higher-order program,

    defunctionalisation, it does not introduce any new data types,
    and the results are more amenable to subsequent analysis operations.
    We can use our method to improve the results of existing
    analysis operations, including strictness analysis, pattern-match
    safety and termination checking. Our transformation is implemented,
    and works on a Core language to which Haskell programs
    can be reduced. Our method cannot always succeed in removing
    all functional values, but in practice is remarkably successful.

abstract:
    This thesis describes techniques for transforming and analysing functional programs. We operate on a core language, to which Haskell programs can be reduced. We present a range of techniques, all of which have been implemented and evaluated.

    We make programs shorter by defining a library which abstracts over common data traversal patterns, removing boilerplate code. This library only supports traversals having value-specific behaviour for one type, allowing a simpler programming model. Our library allows concise expression of traversals with competitive performance.

    We make programs faster by applying a variant of supercompilation. As a result of practical experiments, we have identified modifications to the standard supercompilation techniques -- particularly with respect to let bindings and the generalisation technique.

    We make programs safer by automatically checking for potential pattern-match errors. We define a transformation that takes a higher-order program and produces an equivalent program with fewer functional values, typically a first-order program. We then define an analysis on a first-order language which checks statically that, despite the possible use of partial (or non-exhaustive) pattern matching, no pattern-match failure can occur.

    We describe an automated analysis of Haskell 98 programs to
    check statically that, despite the possible use of partial (or nonexhaustive)
    pattern matching, no pattern-match failure can occur.
    Our method is an iterative backward analysis using a novel form
    of pattern-constraint to represent sets of data values. The analysis
    is defined for a core first-order language to which Haskell 98
    programs are reduced. Our analysis tool has been successfully
    applied to a range of programs, and our techniques seem to scale
    well. Throughout the paper, methods are represented much as we
    have implemented them in practice, again in Haskell.

abstract:
    A function is said to be generic if it operates over values of
    any data type. For example, a generic equality function can test pairs of
    booleans, integers, lists, trees etc. In most languages programmers must
    define generic functions multiple times, specialised for each data type.
    Alternatively, a tool could be used to specify the relationship between the
    data type and the implementation, but this relationship may be complex.
    This paper describes a solution: given a single example of the generic
    function on one data type, we can infer the relationship between a data
    type and the implementation. We have used our method in the Derive
    tool, allowing the implementation of 60% of the generic functions to be
    inferred.

    Generic traversals over recursive data structures are often referred
    to as boilerplate code. The definitions of functions involving such
    traversals may repeat very similar patterns, but with variations for
    different data types and different functionality. Libraries of operations
    abstracting away boilerplate code typically rely on elaborate
    types to make operations generic. The motivating observation for
    this paper is that most traversals have value-specific behaviour for
    just one type. We present the design of a new library exploiting
    this assumption. Our library allows concise expression of traversals
    with competitive performance.

key:   thesis
@at:misc
@institution:University of York
abstract:
    Programs written in Haskell may fail at runtime with either a
    pattern match error, or with non-termination. Both of these can be
    thought of as giving the value $\bot$ as a result. Other forms of
    failure, for example heap exhaustion, are not considered.

    The first section of this document reviews previous work, including
    total functional programming and sized types. Attention is paid to
    termination checkers for both Prolog and various functional
    languages.

    The main result from work so far is a static checker for pattern
    match errors that allows non-exhaustive patterns to exist, yet
    ensures that a pattern match error does not occur. It includes a
    constraint language that can be used to reason about pattern
    matches, along with mechanisms to propagate these constraints
    between program components.

    The proposal deals with future work to be done. It gives an
    approximate timetable for the design and implementation of a static
    checker for termination and pattern match errors.

abstract:
    Most errors in computer programs are only found once they are run, which results in critical errors being missed due to inadequate testing. If additional static analysis is performed, then the possibility exists for detecting such errors, and correcting them. This helps to improve the quality of the resulting code, increasing reliability.

    In this project the existing static analysis research is reviewed, along with implementations used both by normal programmers, and used in safety critical applications. A static analysis program is then designed and implemented for the experimental pointer based language Pasta.

    The resulting program checks for totality, proving that a particular procedure cannot crash and will terminate. Where a procedure does not satisfy this, the preconditions for the procedure are generated.
